# Azure OpenAI PTU Calculator - User Guide

## üéØ What is the PTU Calculator?

The Azure OpenAI PTU Calculator is a professional tool that helps you make smart financial decisions about Azure OpenAI capacity planning. It analyzes your usage patterns and recommends the most cost-effective pricing model for your workloads.

### The Problem It Solves
When using Azure OpenAI, you face three pricing options:
- **PAYGO (Pay-as-you-go)**: Flexible but expensive per token
- **PTU (Provisioned Throughput Units)**: Reserved capacity at lower cost
- **Hybrid**: Mix of PTU base + PAYGO overflow

Without proper analysis, you might:
- ‚ùå Overpay with PAYGO when PTU would be cheaper
- ‚ùå Over-provision PTUs and waste money on unused capacity
- ‚ùå Under-provision and hit throttling limits

### The Solution
Our calculator eliminates guesswork by:
- ‚úÖ Analyzing your actual usage data
- ‚úÖ Calculating precise cost comparisons
- ‚úÖ Recommending the optimal pricing strategy
- ‚úÖ Showing potential savings opportunities

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Quick Start (5 minutes)
1. **Open the calculator** at your deployment URL
2. **Select your region** from the dropdown (e.g., "East US")
3. **Choose your model** (e.g., "GPT-4o", "GPT-4o-mini")
4. **Enter your usage data** (see data input methods below)
5. **Review recommendations** and cost analysis

### Data Input Methods

#### Method 1: Log Analytics (Recommended)
**Best for: Teams with Azure Log Analytics enabled**

1. Run this KQL query in your Log Analytics workspace:
```kql
AzureDiagnostics
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(30d)
| where Category == "RequestResponse"
| summarize 
    avg_tokens_per_minute = avg(prompt_tokens_d + completion_tokens_d),
    p99_tokens_per_minute = percentile(prompt_tokens_d + completion_tokens_d, 99),
    total_requests = count()
| project avg_tokens_per_minute, p99_tokens_per_minute, total_requests
```

2. Copy the results into the calculator fields:
   - **Average TPM**: `avg_tokens_per_minute`
   - **P99 TPM**: `p99_tokens_per_minute`

#### Method 2: Azure Portal Metrics
**Best for: Teams without Log Analytics**

1. Go to **Azure Portal ‚Üí Your OpenAI Resource ‚Üí Metrics**
2. Select metrics for "Total Tokens" over the last 30 days
3. Calculate: `Total Tokens √∑ Minutes in Period = Average TPM`
4. Enter the calculated value in **Average TPM** field

#### Method 3: Manual Estimation
**Best for: Planning new workloads**

1. Estimate your usage patterns:
   - **Small chatbot**: ~1,000-5,000 TPM
   - **Document processing**: ~10,000-50,000 TPM
   - **Large-scale application**: 100,000+ TPM

2. Enter your estimate in the **Average TPM** field

## üéØ Reading the Results

### Recommendation Types

#### "Full PTU Reservation"
- **Meaning**: Reserve all capacity as PTUs
- **When**: High, consistent usage with predictable patterns
- **Savings**: Typically 20-40% vs PAYGO

#### "PAYGO (Pay-as-you-go)"
- **Meaning**: Use on-demand pricing only
- **When**: Low, sporadic, or highly variable usage
- **Benefits**: Maximum flexibility, no capacity commitment

#### "Hybrid (PTU + Overflow)"
- **Meaning**: Reserve base capacity as PTUs, overflow to PAYGO
- **When**: Predictable base load with occasional spikes
- **Benefits**: Cost optimization + flexibility

### Key Metrics to Watch

#### Monthly Cost Comparison
```
PAYGO:    $2,500/month
PTU:      $1,800/month  ‚Üê 28% savings
Hybrid:   $1,950/month  ‚Üê 22% savings
```

#### PTU Utilization
- **80%+**: Excellent utilization, PTU recommended
- **50-80%**: Good utilization, consider hybrid
- **<50%**: Poor utilization, stick with PAYGO

#### Break-even Analysis
- Shows the usage level where PTU becomes cost-effective
- Helps predict when to switch as you scale

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "No recommendation showing"
- **Check**: Ensure you've entered Average TPM > 0
- **Fix**: Enter usage data in at least one field

#### "Warning: Below minimum PTU"
- **Meaning**: Your calculated PTU is below model minimum
- **Impact**: You'll pay for minimum anyway but get extra capacity
- **Action**: Consider higher-capacity models or PAYGO

#### "Invalid region/model combination"
- **Meaning**: Selected model not available in chosen region
- **Fix**: Choose different region or model
- **Check**: Azure OpenAI Service availability page

#### "Calculations seem wrong"
- **Verify**: Check your TPM input (common mistake: RPM vs TPM)
- **Validate**: Compare with Azure Portal billing data
- **Contact**: Reach out if calculations consistently don't match
