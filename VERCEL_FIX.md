# Vercel Deployment Fix

## ðŸ”§ **Dependency Conflict Resolution**

The original error was caused by conflicting dependencies in package.json. Here's what I fixed:

### **Issues Fixed:**
1. **Removed unnecessary dependencies** that were causing conflicts
2. **Simplified package.json** to only include required dependencies
3. **Added .npmrc** with legacy peer deps support
4. **Updated vercel.json** to use `--legacy-peer-deps` flag

### **Clean Dependencies:**
- Only includes the essential packages needed for the PTU calculator
- Removed conflicting packages like `date-fns@4.1.0` and `react-day-picker`
- Uses stable, compatible versions

### **Files Updated:**
- âœ… `package.json` - Clean, minimal dependencies
- âœ… `vercel.json` - Updated install command
- âœ… `.npmrc` - Legacy peer deps configuration
- âœ… Removed `pnpm-lock.yaml` to avoid conflicts

### **Deploy Again:**
```bash
# Push the updated files to your repository
git add .
git commit -m "Fix dependency conflicts for Vercel deployment"
git push

# Or redeploy directly
vercel --prod
```

The deployment should now work without dependency conflicts!
